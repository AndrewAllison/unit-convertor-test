### Getting startedTo work on this project, you will need [.NET Core 1.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core)Once that's installed, you can use the `dotnet` command from a terminal/command window to build/run/test this project.### Building the web app Note: for macOS, you'll the [latest version of OpenSSL](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#macos).1. Open a command window/terminal in the solution folder (that's the folder containing UnitConverterWebApp.sln) and run `dotnet restore` to restore NuGet packages2. Change to the project folder (that's the folder containing UnitConverterWebApp.csproj) and run the command `dotnet build` to build the web app.After the first build, you won't need to restore the NuGet packages - you'll only need `dotnet build`.### Running the web appOpen a command window in the project folder (that's the folder containing UnitConverterWebApp.csproj) and use the command `dotnet run` which will build the web app and run it listening on localhost. It should produce output like:```Hosting environment: ProductionContent root path: C:\Users\ukwhuds\Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Projects\UnitConverterWebApp\UnitConverterWebAppNow listening on: http://localhost:5000Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.```Then you can go to http://localhost:5000 in a browser to use the app.### Running the testsOpen a command window in the tests folder (that's the folder containing UnitConverterTests.csproj) and use the command `dotnet test` which will build the app and then run the tests; it should produce output like:```Build started, please wait...                                                                                                                  Build completed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Test run for C:\Users\ukwhuds\Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Projects\UnitConverterWebApp\UnitConverterTests\bin\Debug\netcoreapp1.1\UnitConverterTests.dll(.NETCoreApp,Version=v1.1)                                                                                                           Microsoft (R) Test Execution Command Line Tool Version 15.0.0.0                                                                                Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the easiest C# editor from Microsoft to install, but [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) has more functionally. Or you could keep it simple (and fast) with something like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
