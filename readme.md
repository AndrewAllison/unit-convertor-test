### ExampleThis was a bit of a test I was sent, I had a few different cracks at it and would welcome anyfeedback people have on it.### Getting startedTo work on this project, you will need [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core)Once that's installed, you can use the `dotnet` command from a terminal/command window to build/run/test this project.### Building the web app 1. Open a command window/terminal in the solution folder (that's the folder containing UnitConverterWebApp.sln) and run `dotnet restore` to restore NuGet packages2. Change to the project folder (that's the folder containing UnitConverterWebApp.csproj) and run the command `dotnet build` to build the web app.After the first build, you won't need to restore the NuGet packages - you'll only need `dotnet build`.### Running the web appOpen a command window in the project folder (that's the folder containing UnitConverterWebApp.csproj) and use the command `dotnet run` which will build the web app and run it listening on localhost. It should produce output like:Then you can go to http://localhost:5000 in a browser to use the app.### Running the testsOpen a command window in the tests folder (that's the folder containing UnitConverterTests.csproj) and use the command `dotnet test` which will build the app and then run the tests; it should produce output like:
